function C = SIFTPoolingCells(patchsize,nr_cells,nr_scales,nr_orientations)

%FUNCTION generates SIFT pooling cells to perform local spatial pooling of the feature
%map
%
%   C = SIFTPoolingCells(patchsize,nr_cells)   
%
% INPUT :
%   patchsize - pixel size of the local image patch to be pooled, i.e. a patchsize x patchsize neighborhood is considered
%	nr_cells  - number of cells along one dimension (4 in the SIFT descriptor to get a 4x4 pooling)
%   nr_scales - number of scales of the filter bank (used to create pooling matrix of proper dimension to speed up pooling)
%   nr_orientations - number of orientations of the filter bank
%
% OUTPUT :
%	C - cell vector of size nr_cells whose entries are matrices of size patchsize x patchsize x nr_scales x nr_orientations. 
%   The 3rd and 4th dimension are just repeatings of the patchsize x patchsize matrix, the matrix which defines the spatial 
%   weighting of this cell
%
% The implementation follows the bilinear weighting between squared cells
% as in Lowe's SIFT descriptor
